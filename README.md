# Exploratory-Aviation-Delay-and-Review-Analysis
Data analysis of Flight dataset combined with weather data and User review data to analyze causes for aviation delay 

## Objective
- To identify causes of flight delays
- Build a model that can predict the delay based on such factors.
- Test the model for accuracy.
- Perform text-analysis on user reviews to get a sense of common-topics.

This will help airline companies understand what impacts their performace and users would be able to plan ahead
of time by prediciting the delays on chosen routes.

## Datasets

Three Datasets:

- Flights Data - Origin, Destination, DepDelay, Time, Carrier, Cancellation, etc.
- Weather Data - Time, wind, precipitation, visibility, location, etc.
- User Reviews Data - Carrier, time, review, rating, class, author_details, etc.
